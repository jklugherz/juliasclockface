Clock face for Fitbit Versa created by Julia Klugherz. 

As I was scrolling through available clock faces for my watch on the Fitbit App Store, I couldn't find one that I really liked. 
I wanted a simple design with some of my stats (steps, distance, heart rate, stairs climbed, active minutes, and watch battery life) but not all of them.
