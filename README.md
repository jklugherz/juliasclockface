Clock face for Fitbit Versa created by Julia Klugherz. 

As I was scrolling through available clock faces for my watch on the Fitbit Clockface Store, I did not find any that were sufficient for my needs. I wanted a simple design with some of my stats (steps, distance, heart rate, stairs climbed, active minutes, and watch battery life) so that whenever I glanced at my wrist, I wouldn't have to search for them on the small screen.

The next steps for this project are bug fixes, deploying to the Fitbit Store, and ultimately making it possible for users to choose which stats to display.
